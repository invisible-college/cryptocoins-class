Social Applications
===================

Are cryptocoins just another means for the rich to get richer,
to widen wealth inequality, and to further unsustainable, short-term capitalism?

Here are ways to apply Bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchains toward the social good and public benefit.

* Checking accounts for people who don’t have enough for a minimum balance
* Store of value in countries undergoing upheaval who don’t want to rely on the dollar.
* Remittance of expatriates to their home countries, faster and more reliable than a wire transfer.
* Titled asset transfer and escrow (home ownership)
* Distributed Autonomous Organizations (or robocorporations)
* Smart contracts for running cooperative businesses and profit-sharing
