Blockchains
===========

Blockchains are the generic term for the distributed technology that achieves consensus
on some resource using a hashing algorithm. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most
famous examples.

Some words you'll hear to u

# AltCoins

An altcoin is used to describe an alternative coin.
It has a slightly pejorative meaning, in that it is not as significant as Bitcoin.
However, many coins began in obscurity and eventually emerged as valuable
commodities and tools in their own right, namely Ethereum in 2015 and Litecoin in 2017.

What other coins are there?

Each coin has to answer the same questions:

* What hashing algorithm to use?
* What consensus algorithm? (PoW? PoS?)
* How to distribute coins initially? (ICO)

Practically [one for every letter of the alphabet](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_eth):

* LTC the silver to Bitcoinâ€™s gold
* NXT for voting and verifiable polls
* NEM proof of importance
* XMR / ZEC for privacy
