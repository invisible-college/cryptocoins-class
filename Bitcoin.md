Bitcoin
=======

Bitcoin is the first, most famous, and most valuable cryptocurrency in existence.
It was invented in 2009 by someone known as Satoshi Nakomoto, who released a [research paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and a
[reference implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) which is still runs the majority of the world's bitcoin nodes.

Using some powerful ideas from cryptography and distributed computing, Bitcoin solves the long-standing
problems of how to create digital cash.

At the time of this writing (May 2017) it is at an all-time high price of 1,764 USD and has a total market capitalization of
$29 trillion.

# Desiderata

What do we want from money, whether it's dollars, gold, or a cryptocoin?
Here's a list based on past human needs

* Unforgeable (hard to counterfeit)
* Liquid (there's enough of it to be common)
* Limited (not too liquid)
* Fast (easy to transfer and spend)
* Fungible (interchangeable, anonymous)

All currencies are a unit of account and a store of value. They measure goods and services that people use and provide.

Dollars, euros, rupees, renminbi, yen, and all government-issued currencies are known as *fiat* currencies
because they have value mandated by a country, backed by a reserve bank and a military, required as tax payments.
They are almost always inflationary, usually as a result of governments issuing debt / printing more money to loan
to themselves.

Bitcoin, and other cryptocoins, have some of the following properties that make them different
* Not usually controlled by a central organization, and never by a government
* Deflationary, or with slowed inflation
* Has no physical embodiment, can be transacted anywhere there's internet
* Also hard to forbid / prevent / outlaw
