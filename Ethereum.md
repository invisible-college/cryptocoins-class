Ethereum
========

Bitcoin was the watershed event in blockchain history and instigated the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies that we have today.
However, Bitcoin itself had several major limitations.

* Slow block time (10 minutes)
* Not programmable. Transactions happen either as all-or-nothing (value-blind).
* Centralized to a few superpowers (Chinese billionaires)
* Not environmentally friendly

As a result of these, Vitalik Buterin unveiled his plan to build a platform for decentralized apps (dapps),
or smart contracts, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in 2013 when he was in his early 20s.

Words used to describe Ethereum and its apps are: "world multi-computer, unstoppable apps, trustless".

Ethereum is important for many reasons. These four stand out in my mind, and support each other as guiding principles.
* The first time a coin was issued to raise funds for its own development, like a company. (ICO)
  * This provided incentives for developers to safeguard Ethereum and its community, without being beholden to shareholders or outside corporations.
* This foundation and its leader provides continuing guidance and philosophy for development and research, including hardforks, including the famous DAO hack of 2016.
* It is a transcoin, in that it can be used to implement any other coin on top of it. (almost Turing-complete)
* From the beginning, it included a plan to switch to Proof-of-Stake, which doesn't consume a done of electricity like Proof-of-Work.
  * Like a B-Corp in cryptocoins.
